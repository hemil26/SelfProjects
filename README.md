# SelfProjects
These are some projects which i have made
## GUI Projects
### Login System using GUI
This was my first project in GUI and i have used python Tkinter it just included the basic details of a new user and existing user. I have used the OS module and stored the usernames and password in text file. It will print error if the username is already taken and will check if the email is valid or not
### HangMan GUI game
I have learnt more and new things by working on this project . I have learnt the process of key-binding , placing and deleting the image after a event,modifying the texts and many more. 
ABOUT THIS PROJECT - Its just a basic hangman game and as soon as you type a letter if it is there in that word it will display it or else the man will be near to death and soon will be hanged and you will lose.
